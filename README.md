# Get-it-done

A productivity and scheduling web application running on Node.js and mongoDB. Allows user to set a long term goal, break it up into smaller milestones, then further break it up into 
weekly tasks, which will be determined by user each week, then randomized each day. The idea behind this app, is to be able to keep track of your goals in one place, and keep your workflow interesting by changing things up every day.

This app is a work in progress
